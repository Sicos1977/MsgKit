    ///     be mapped to property IDs that are valid for that message store. The reverse is also true. When properties need to

        3.2.1.1 Fetching the Name Identifier
         * 
        In this example, property ID 0x8005 has to be mapped to its property name. First, the entry index into the entry stream (1) is determined:
        Property ID – 0x8000
        =0x8005 – 0x8000
        =0x0005
        Then, the offset for the corresponding 8-byte entry is determined:
        Entry index * size of entry
        = 0x05 * 0x08
        = 0x28
        The offset is then used to fetch the entry from the entry stream (1) ("__substg1.0_00030102"), which is contained inside the named property 
        mapping storage ("__nameid_version1.0"). In this case, bytes 40 – 47 are fetched from the stream (1). Then, the structure specified in the 
        entry stream (1) section is applied to those bytes, taking into consideration that the data is stored in little-endian format.
